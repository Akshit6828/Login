2. Upon login checks the existence of the user in the database.
3. If the user is found in the database _(via API and not using Database Methods)_ , it enables the login gateway and lets the user access its profile.
4. If the user is not found, it wonâ€™t give access to the login gateway and takes the user to the registration page.
